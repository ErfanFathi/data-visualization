# Data Visualization Final Project [UniGe]

## Overview
This project presents an in-depth analysis of global health data through a series of interactive visualizations. Utilizing D3.js and Bootstrap, it showcases how life expectancy correlates with various economic indicators and demographic data across different countries and over time.

## Visualizations
1. **Bar Chart**: Displays the top 20 countries with the highest life expectancy, highlighting the disparities in longevity across nations.

2. **Line Chart**: Tracks the minimum, average, and maximum life expectancy over different years, providing insights into global health trends.

3. **Scatter Plot**: Explores the relationship between GDP per capita and life expectancy, with data points color-coded by year.

4. **Bubble Chart**: Illustrates the correlation between GDP per capita, life expectancy, and population size, offering a multi-dimensional perspective on global health.

5. **Choropleth Map**: Presents a global view of life expectancy, with countries colored based on their average life expectancy, revealing geographical patterns in health outcomes.

## Data Source
The data for this project comes from the World Health Organization (WHO), encompassing various indicators like GDP, population, and life expectancy.
